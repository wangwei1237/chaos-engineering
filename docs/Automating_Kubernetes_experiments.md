# 11 Automating Kubernetes experiments

This chapter covers

* Automating chaos experiments for Kubernetes with PowerfulSeal
* Recognizing the difference between one-off experiments and ongoing SLO verification
* Designing chaos experiments on the VM level using cloud provider APIs

In this second helping of Kubernetes goodness, weâ€™ll see how to use higher-level tools to implement chaos experiments. In the previous chapter we set things up manually to build the understanding of how to implement the experiment. But now that you know that, I want to show you how much more quickly you can go when using the right tools. Enter PowerfulSeal.
