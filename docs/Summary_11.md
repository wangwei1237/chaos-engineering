# 11.4 Summary
* High-level tools like PowerfulSeal make it easy to implement sophisticated chaos engineering scenarios, but before jumping into using them, it’s important to understand how the underlying technology works
* Some chaos experiments work best as an ongoing validation, such as verifying that an SLO isn’t violated
* We can easily simulate machine failure by using the cloud provider’s API to take VMs down and bring them back up again, just like the original Chaos Monkey did
